This is a working odoo server with postgres in the same docker-compose.

It works well but i don't use it for a production environment.

# How it's works

- Download file
- Run
   `docker-compose up -d`
- You need to wait it will download odoo and postgres in your local machino
- Use it with http://localhost:8069   (this port is the default odoo port)
- Create a database and start working with odoo!
